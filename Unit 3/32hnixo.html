<BODY BGCOLOR=”ffffff” TEXT=”ff5e5e”>
    <H1> This shows up as a title with large letters</H1>
    <P>This paragraph will be the color that was set in the BODY tag.</P>
    <P>
        <FONT COLOR=”0f0a09”>This is my second paragraph. It will be the font color set in the FONT tag that was placed
            before it. Like most HTML tags, the FONT tag needs to have another tag to close it when you want the color
            to change back to the color of the text that was set in the BODY tag. </FONT>
    </P>
    <P>This text will revert to the color set in the BODY tag.</P>
