            To emphasize <em>words of importance</em> we can use the EM tag <em>as many times as</em> we need it. Sometimes
            we <em>need</em> a <strong>stronger</strong> feeling to an emphasized word and would be <em>more apt</em> to use the <strong>STRONG</strong> tag.  
            </li>
            <li>
            If we wanted to make some <code>text stand out</code> in a sentence so the reader would be <em>aware</em> of
            <code>which words</code> we wanted them to <strong>notice</strong>, we can use the CODE tag because it would make those
            words <code>look differently than the rest</code> of the sentence.   
            </li>
            <li>
            Finally, if you wanted to have a definition <dfn>precede</dfn> (come before) or follow a word, you could make this more <dfn>obvious</dfn>, easier to
            notice, by putting the DFN tags around the word to be defined.
            </li>
